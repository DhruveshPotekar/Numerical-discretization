# Numerical_discretization
In this we are going to understand the difference in the values obtained by analytical and numerical derivative.\
The function is

We are also going to see how the error minimizes when we decrease the value of dx.\
I have used both first order and second order approximation, and the results show us that second order approximation has less error than first order for the same value of dx.
